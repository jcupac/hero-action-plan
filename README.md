# hero-action-plan

This is an ATDD Sandbox Project. I'm making it to learn how to write clear acceptance tests before implementing functionality, and to understand how tests can guide development. By using a simple, self-contained project, I can focus on improving my testing and development skills without worrying about production issues.
